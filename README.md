We introduce a new data-driven approach that directly predicts the likelihood of toxicity in clinical trials. The model integrates properties of a compoundâ€™s targets and its structure to provide a new measure. Drug target network connectivity and expression levels, along with molecular weight, were identified as important indicators of adverse clinical events. Altogether, our method provides a data-driven broadly applicable strategy to identify drugs likely to possess manageable toxicity in clinical trials and will help drive the design of therapeutic agents with less toxicity.
